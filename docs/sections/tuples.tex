\section{Tuples}

Tuples are simply lists of expressions, each expression is paired with
a seperator with the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the expression is paired with \texttt{,} then the expression is 
        non-vanishing, that is its value is evaluated, and an entry in the final tuple.

    \item If the expression is paired with \texttt{,} then the expression is 
        vanishing, that is its value is evaluated, and its not an entry in the final tuple.

    \item Last item can be without a pair, in this case its interpreted as a non-vanishing entry. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{(1,2)}.
    \item \texttt{([3,4],Max(4,3),(1,2))}.
    \item \texttt{([3,4];Max(4,3),(1,2);)}.
\end{enumerate}
