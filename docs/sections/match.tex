\section{Matching}

Matches are expression that evalutes to a value and they have the
following syntax

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Prolog]
    match Expression {
        Exp1 => Result1,
        Exp2 => Result2,
        ...
        ExpN => ResultN,
        else => Result
    }
\end{lstlisting}

When \texttt{Resulti} are tuples or tuple entries.

Note that the \texttt{else} is optional.

\subsection{Example}

\begin{lstlisting}[language =Prolog]
        match List {
            [] => [],
            [L | Ls] => [1 | Ls]
        }
    \end{lstlisting}
