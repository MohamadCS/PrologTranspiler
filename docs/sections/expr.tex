\section{Expressions}

Expressions in \texttt{Prolog*} are on of the following
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tuples.
    \item Functions invocation.
    \item Extended Prolog term. 
    \item Lambda.
    \item Matching statment.
    \item If-else statements.
\end{itemize}

We will expand on each one of them later.
